      learn web development.

    <h3>My first step into learning HTML</h3>
    <p>
      HTML courses are not hard to find these days. I just started researching
      how to learn HTML. So, I found some sites that were offering free HTML
      courses. Here are some sites that offer free HTML courses.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">codecademy</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">freecodecamp</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I learned basic HTML from Code Academy. Then I went to Freecodecamp to
      learn more about HTML and from there I learned alot more about HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
      After completing free web development courses I bought full stack web
      development course from udemy to enhance my knowledge in web development.

    <h4>How I Practiced HTML!</h4>

    <p>
      I used to practice HTML on a daily basis because I knew that practice
      makes you better in any field.
    </p>

    <h4>How I felt during this HTML journey!</h4>
    <p>
      It wasn't difficult at all because when you have the mindset to do
      something or you really want to do it or you like doing computer stuff
      like me. It becomes easier for you.
    </p>

      That was all about my HTML journey. I hope this helps you on your HTML
      journey if you've just started one. BTW I have a link to an HTML video
      tutorial for you which can help you a lot in your HTML journey.
