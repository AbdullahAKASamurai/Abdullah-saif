    <h3>My first step into learning CSS</h3>
    <p>
      I did some research to find sites that were offering free CSS courses And
      I found some sites that are offering free CSS courses.

    <h3>Time to learn CSS</h3>

    <p>
      I learned basic CSS from Code Academy. Then I went to Freecodecamp to
      learn more about CSS and from there I learned alot more about CSS.

      After completing free web development courses I bought full stack web
      development course from udemy to enhance my knowledge in web development.

    <h4>How I Practiced CSS!</h4>

    <p>
      I used to practice CSS on a daily basis because I knew that practice makes
      you better in any field.
    </p>

    <h4>How I felt during this CSS journey!</h4>
    <p>
      It wasn't difficult at all because when you have the mindset to do
      something or you really want to do it or you like doing computer stuff
      like me. It becomes easier for you.
