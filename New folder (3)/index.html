    <h1>My journey to become a Web Developer!</h1>

    <p>
      HI, i'm Abdullah Saif. I have just started my journey of learning web
      development.

    <h2 id="why">Why i decided to learn Web development!</h2>

    <p>
      As we all know that now is the era of computer science. I was already a
      big fan of computer subjects. My computer book had a chapter on web design
      and that chapter sparked my interest in web development.

    <h3 id="js">Learing JS(Java Script)</h3>

    <p>
      I haven't started learning JS yet as I am busy with some aspects of my
      life.
